Hey, I'm Michael Cook. Before learning to program, I was a graduate student pursuing an academic career. After I realized academia wasn't for me, I 
began searching for a different career paths. In 2018 I read [a book on JavaScript](https://nostarch.com/javascriptforkids), and never looked back! The more I learned, the 
more of a serious student I became. The more I was challenged, the more I was driven to build my own projects and master difficult programming concepts.
In the spring of this year I enrolled in an online JavaScript bootcamp to round off my skills and prepare to enter the job market!

This page is devoted to summarizing what I know, what I am familiar with, and who I am.
